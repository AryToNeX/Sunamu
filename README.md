# NowPlaying but on Electron and with support of MPRIS players

You have to run it from source for the time being. I don't really want to bundle it because I am lazy.

Original idea is https://github.com/busybox11/NowPlaying-for-Spotify

hello btw

(if you are intelligent enough, you will make it run yourself)

(also yes spotify is borked do not use it with spoti pls)
